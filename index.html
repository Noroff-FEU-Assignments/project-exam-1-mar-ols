          <p>
            On September 3rd 2018 me and my then-boyfriend set out on a trip
            along, almost, the entire coast of Norway. I had just registered as
            a fisherman and had purchased an old shrimp boat which was located
            in T√∏nsberg.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our task was to transport it to a tiny village called Hav√∏ysund in
            the north of Norway, with population: 1000.
          </p>
          <p>
            We briefly contemplated having it transported by trailer, but for a
            newly started company without a lot of funds, decided it was too
            expensive. So the only other option was to go the distance by sea.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I was also moving North, we first had to take the boat to
            Larvik and pack as much of my things as we could onto this tiny 26ft
            yoghurt cup. We had boxes and boxes of stuff, including a 55‚Äù TV (it
            did not survive the trip).
          </p>
          <p>
            The boat did not have any running water, no toilet installed and our
            ‚Äúbed‚Äù was only a mattress topper placed right on top of the cabin
            sole (the floor inside the cabin, although calling it a cabin is
            quite a generous description). Our kitchen was a rusty, camper stove
            with two burners.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trip would take roughly 3 weeks with 10-16 hours stretches each
            day (minus the days at port if the weather was too rough). I only
            lost half my mind on the way. ü´†
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, it was not an action-packed trip, luckily for us. But
            perhaps boring for you to read about, if you expect a lot of crazy
            adventures. We had no major incidents and the waters were calm. The
            rougher fall weather was constantly chasing us, but with the long
            days we managed to outsail it almost the entire way.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yes, no toilet meant a bucket on deck with the best views you
            could ask for.
